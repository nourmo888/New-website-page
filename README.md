# New-website-page
Decide whether the new page is better than the older one or not
A project for the sake of choosing the best website page between 2 ones.
I have started by asking questions to help to determine which page is better.
In the second part, I used the probability.
Whilst in the third part, I depended on more advanced techniques using the statistical concepts and regression models to reach answers.

In the final part, I made a summary of the results.
